# Labeling-using-Active-Learning
Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the "Labeling of Sugarbeet Plants Using Active Learning" thesis project. The project focuses on developing a labeling system that utilizes active learning techniques to annotate sugarbeet plants efficiently.

**Description**
This project aims to create a system that can accurately label sugarbeet plants efficiently and cost-effectively. Traditional manual labeling methods require extensive human effort and can be time-consuming and expensive. By incorporating active learning techniques, we aim to reduce the labeling effort by intelligently selecting the most informative samples for annotation.

The project utilizes deep learning algorithms to train models capable of identifying and labeling sugarbeet plants. Active learning strategies are employed to actively select samples most likely to improve the model's performance when labeled. This iterative process optimizes the labeling effort by prioritizing samples that contribute the most to the model's learning.
